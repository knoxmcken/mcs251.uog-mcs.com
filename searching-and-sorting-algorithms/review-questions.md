# ‚ùì Review Questions

Answer these questions by explanation.

1. What are the key differences between linear search and binary search in terms of their algorithmic approach and time complexity? Provide an example of when you might prefer to use one over the other.
2. Explain the Bubble Sort algorithm and its time complexity. In what kind of scenarios might Bubble Sort be a suitable choice for sorting a list?
3. Compare and contrast Quick Sort and Merge Sort. Discuss their respective algorithms, time complexities, and any advantages or disadvantages they may have. In which situations might you prefer to use one over the other?
4. What does it mean for a sorting algorithm to be 'stable'? Which of the three sorting algorithms discussed above (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort) are stable, and why is stability important in certain applications?
5. In the Python implementations provided for the sorting algorithms, what is the primary purpose of the base cases for the recursive functions in Quick Sort and Merge Sort? How do these base cases help ensure that the recursion eventually terminates?
