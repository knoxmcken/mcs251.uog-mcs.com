# Graphs: Review Questions

### Review Questions

1. What are the key differences between an undirected graph and a directed graph? Provide an example of a real-world scenario where each type of graph might be applicable.
2. Compare and contrast adjacency matrices and adjacency lists as graph representations. What are the pros and cons of each method, and when might one be preferred over the other?
3. Explain the Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal technique used for graphs. Describe its algorithm and give an example of a scenario where BFS might be particularly useful.
4. Explain the Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal technique used for graphs. Describe its algorithm and give an example of a scenario where DFS might be particularly useful.
5. In the context of graph traversal, compare and contrast the use of recursion and an explicit stack data structure for implementing the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?
