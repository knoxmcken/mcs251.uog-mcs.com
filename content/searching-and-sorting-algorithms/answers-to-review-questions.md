1. Linear search iterates through each element of a list or array sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached, with a time complexity of$$O(n)$$. Binary search, on the other hand, works on sorted lists or arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the middle element with the target element until the target is found or the search interval is empty, with a time complexity of$$O(\log n)$$. You might prefer to use linear search when the list is unsorted and the size of the list is small. Binary search is preferred when the list is sorted and the size is large, as it offers faster search times.
2. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues to do this until no more swaps are needed. Its time complexity is $$O(n^2)$$in the worst and average cases and $O(n)$ in the best case (when the list is already sorted). Bubble Sort is suitable for small datasets or when the list is already partially sorted, as it has a relatively low overhead and is easy to implement.
3. Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element from the list and partitions the other elements into two groups (less than the pivot and greater than the pivot), then recursively sorts the two groups. Quick Sort has a worst-case time complexity of $$O(n^2)$$but an average and best-case time complexity of$$O(n \log n)$$. Merge Sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm that works by dividing the list into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and merging the sorted halves. Merge Sort has a time complexity of$$O(n \log n)$$in all cases. Quick Sort is often faster in practice and requires less space, but it is not stable and its worst-case performance can be poor. Merge Sort is stable and has consistent performance, but it requires more space.
4. A sorting algorithm is 'stable' if it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted list. In other words, if two elements are equal, their order in the sorted list will be the same as their order in the input list. Among the three sorting algorithms discussed, Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are stable, while Quick Sort is not. Stability is important in certain applications where the relative order of equal elements carries meaning or significance, such as in sorting records based on multiple fields.
5. The base cases in the recursive functions for Quick Sort and Merge Sort serve to ensure that the recursion eventually terminates. In both algorithms, the base cases are triggered when the list to be sorted has one or fewer elements. Since a list with only one element is already sorted by definition, the base case returns the list itself without any further processing. As the algorithms recursively divide the list into smaller sublists, they eventually reach sublists of size one or zero, which activates the base cases and allows the recursion to terminate.
